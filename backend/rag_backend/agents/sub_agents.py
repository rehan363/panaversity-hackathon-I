EXAMPLE:
If given technical content about "DDS middleware":

**Simple Definition:**
DDS is like a translator that helps different robot parts talk to each other.

**Real-World Analogy:**
Think of DDS like a post office. Different robot parts (like sensors and motors) are like houses in a neighborhood. DDS delivers messages between them, making sure the right message gets to the right place at the right time.

**Why It Matters:**
Without DDS, robot parts couldn't coordinate their actions, like trying to have a conversation where everyone speaks different languages.

**Key Takeaway:**
DDS is the communication backbone that makes ROS 2 robots work together smoothly.

| Feature | ROS 1 | ROS 2 |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Communication | XMLRPC | DDS |
| Real-time | Limited | Better support |
| Security | Minimal | Enhanced |

### Key Differences:
- ROS 2 uses DDS middleware for more reliable communication
- ROS 2 has better real-time performance for industrial applications
- ROS 2 includes security features missing in ROS 1

### When to Use Each:
- **Use ROS 1** if: Working with legacy systems or older tutorials
- **Use ROS 2** if: Starting new projects or need production-grade reliability
