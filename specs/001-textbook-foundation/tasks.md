# Tasks: Physical AI Textbook Foundation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-textbook-foundation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No test tasks included (not requested in spec; Phase 1 focuses on content delivery)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app (static site)**: `docs/` for content, `src/` for custom components, `static/` for assets
- Paths follow Docusaurus conventions per plan.md

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T013) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion (T014-T019)
  - User Story 1 (Phase 3): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (Phase 4): Can start after Foundational (independent of US1, but logically follows for content flow)
  - User Story 3 (Phase 5): Depends on US2 completion (needs content to navigate)
  - User Story 4 (Phase 6): Depends on US1-3 completion (needs full site to test responsive)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories (US1-4) being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Logically follows US1 but technically independent
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US2 completion (T063) - Requires content to exist for navigation testing
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1-3 completion (T075) - Requires full site for comprehensive responsive testing

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Homepage)**:
- All tasks T020-T027 can be worked in parallel (different sections of same file)
- T028 (verification) must come last

**User Story 2 (Week 1-2 Content)**:
- Week 1 content (T029-T037) independent of Week 2 content (T042-T051)
- Visual aids (T038-T041, T052-T057) can be created in parallel with writing
- Content quality verification (T058-T063) must come after all content/images complete

**User Story 3 (Navigation)**:
- Configuration tasks (T064-T066) can run in parallel
- Testing tasks (T067-T075) must run sequentially to verify each navigation path

**User Story 4 (Mobile)**:
- All mobile testing tasks (T076-T086) can run in parallel if multiple devices/viewports available

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T003, T004, T005, T006 can run in parallel (different config files)
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T007, T008, T009, T011, T012 can run in parallel (different directories/files)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T014, T015, T016, T017 can run in parallel (independent files)
- **US1**: T020, T021 can run together; T022, T023, T024, T025, T026 can run together (different sections)
- **US2**: Week 1 content (T029-T037) and Week 2 content (T042-T051) can run in parallel
- **US2**: Visual aids T038, T039, T052, T053, T054 can all be created in parallel (different images)
- **US2**: T058, T059, T060, T061, T062 verification tasks can run in parallel
- **US3**: T064, T065, T066 configuration tasks can run in parallel
- **US4**: T076, T077, T078, T082, T083, T084, T085, T086 can run in parallel (different viewports/devices)
- **Phase 7**: T087, T088, T089, T090 Lighthouse audits can run in parallel; T091 can run independently

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Week 1-2 Content)

```bash
# Launch Week 1 and Week 2 content creation in parallel:
Task: "Write Week 1 section 1-5 in week1-foundations.md"
Task: "Write Week 2 section 1-6 in week2-landscape.md"

# Launch all visual aids creation in parallel:
Task: "Create physical-ai-comparison.svg in docs/assets/week1/"
Task: "Create embodied-intelligence-diagram.svg in docs/assets/week1/"
Task: "Create sensor-types-overview.svg in docs/assets/week2/"
Task: "Create or find lidar-point-cloud.webp in docs/assets/week2/"
Task: "Create imu-axes.svg in docs/assets/week2/"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T013)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T014-T019) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T020-T028) - Homepage
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T029-T063) - Week 1-2 Content
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test independently, deploy, demo
6. This gives you 100 hackathon base points (Docusaurus site + RAG-ready content)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy (Homepage live!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy (Content readable!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy (Navigation enhanced!)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy (Mobile-friendly!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T019)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T020-T028)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 Week 1 (T029-T041)
   - Developer C: User Story 2 Week 2 (T042-T057)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

| Phase 7: Polish | T087-T100 (14 tasks) | 2-3 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **100 tasks** | **14-22 hours** |

**MVP (US1-2 only)**: 8-12 hours
**Full Phase 1**: 14-22 hours

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No automated tests in Phase 1 (focus on content delivery, manual validation)
- Commit frequently (after each logical task group or at each checkpoint)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before continuing
- Week 1-2 content establishes template for future Weeks 3-13 (Phase 3 - Content Scale)
- Phase 2 (RAG integration) will build upon this foundation
